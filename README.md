This is the repository of some of the code I wrote for my master's thesis where I worked with big data sets. 

This readme explains shortly which files are in this repository:

1. Prepare data: 
prepare data is the code that turned the original dataset into a data table that can be used for further analysis.
To acchive this several things had to be modified in the original dataset. 

2. Make SSD: 
In this File Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs) are created from the data. 

3. Venn diagrams: 
Venn diagrams were created to create an overview of the available data.

4. SSD range comparison: 
This file creates boxplots of the range of the Species Sensitivity Distributions for acute and chronic data of every species group.

5. randomised SSD:
Species Sensitivity Distributions were created with a random sample of tests. This was done to analyze the distribution of the meassured test concentrations
