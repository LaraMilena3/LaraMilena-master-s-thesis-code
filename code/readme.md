There are three types of codes here, which are separated by folders. 

Data_preparations: 
This takes the original datasets downloaded from Ecotoxicological databases and modifies it into a way that can be used for analysis. This includes making species sensitivity distribution (SSDs)

Variability_analysis:
To assess within and between species variability and to assess if the within species variation is independent of the between species variability, two ways to measure the variability were compared

Visualisation:
The Data could be visualised in different ways to show differences between groups. Some of the visualisations created during the project are in this folder.
