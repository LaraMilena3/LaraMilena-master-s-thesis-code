the within and between species variation was calculated in two ways. 

In random_SSD.R species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) were created by using a random selection of tests. 
For every species that has been tested with a chemical a random tests was used to create an SSD. 

In variability_multiplied.R The innerspecies variation is multiplied by the between species variation

both files create a density plot to visualize the variability
